//! mouser-clipboard — the **clipboard sync engine** (docs/communication-interface.md §7.7).
//!
//! A pure, deterministic state machine ([`ClipboardEngine`]) that drives one device's
//! side of the §7.7 clipboard protocol over the message catalog
//! (`ClipboardOffer` → `ClipboardPull` → `ClipboardData`). Like [`mouser-files`] it is
//! I/O-free except through narrow seams, so the logic is unit-testable with **no OS
//! clipboard calls** and reusable unchanged by `mouser-engine`:
//!
//! - [`source::ClipContentSource`] — answers an inbound `ClipboardPull` with the
//!   canonical bytes of a representation this device offered.
//! - [`source::LocalRepr`] in / [`source::AppliedClip`] out — the caller hands the
//!   engine the local clipboard's raw representations to offer, and the engine hands
//!   back hash-verified content to write to the OS clipboard.
//!
//! ## What the engine enforces (§7.7)
//! - **Canonical hashing** ([`canonical`]): `hash = SHA-256(canonical(format, bytes))`
//!   so both ends agree on the pull/dedup/integrity key (text CRLF→LF + no trailing
//!   NUL; html/rtf/png as-is; uri_list LF-separated no trailing blank).
//! - **Eager auto-pull**: an inbound offer is answered immediately with a pull for the
//!   best accepted representation (`png` > `rtf` > `html` > `uri_list` > `utf8_text`),
//!   so content is in flight before the user pastes.
//! - **Prefer-native between Apple devices**: when both ends are `macos`/`ios` and the
//!   setting is on, Mouser suppresses its own sync and lets the OS Universal Clipboard
//!   carry it ([`settings::prefer_native_suppresses`]) — per peer pair, not global.
//! - **Transport by size**: a small text payload rides one control-stream message; a
//!   `png`/over-cap payload is split into ≤ 1 MiB ordered bulk chunks.
//! - **Reassembly + progress + verify** ([`reassembly`]): inbound chunks accumulate by
//!   hash, expose [`reassembly::Progress`] for the "Pasting from <device>…" indicator,
//!   and the reassembled SHA-256 is verified against the offer's hash — dropped on
//!   mismatch, never applied.
//! - **Loop prevention**: a locally-applied `(origin, hash)` is recorded and never
//!   re-offered.
//! - **Settings gates** ([`settings`]): the master switch, per-format gates, auto-sync
//!   size limit, and direction are enforced **on send** *and* **on receipt**.
//!
//! [`mouser-files`]: https://docs.rs/mouser-files
//!
//! The runtime path is panic-free: `[workspace.lints.clippy]` denies
//! `unwrap_used`/`panic`/`indexing_slicing` crate-wide.
